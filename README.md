# Color match

### Game Idea 
The core idea is to make a 2D game with falling blocks, in a similar way to the famous Tetris. The difference is that the blocks can change color i.g. if you put a red block on a blue block they will turn into green block. When 3 or 5 blocks of the same color are connecting they will disappear. Another difference is that only one block, a square, is falling instead of a combination of blocks, like tetris. The goal is to make the blocks go away before they fill up the screen. You will get more points the longer you survive.

Another inspiration beside Tetris, is the “I love hue” game, which is a color puzzle game.

### Game Tech 
The game development tool Unity will be used.
Progression in the Game
It is difficult to make variation in the game, but one option is to add levels and make it harder with more colors. It is also fun if you can compete against friends and see a highscore list.

### In-game tutoring approach
The game will be teached while the player is playing it for the first time. The instruction, a simple text with arrows, will appear next to the falling blocks and instruct the player how to control it. It is only two colors in the beginning so the player can focus on the instruction.
